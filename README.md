# S2FOW (Source2 Fog Of War)

![S2FOW Action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karola3vax/server-assets/main/s2fow.gif)

Server-side anti-wallhack for Counter-Strike 2. Hides enemy players that the server cannot confirm are visible.

No client-side data means no wallhack can reveal them — the information simply does not exist on their machine.

## How It Works

Every network frame, S2FOW:

1. Snapshots every player's position, bounds, speed, and weapon
2. For each human player, checks every enemy with RayTrace line-of-sight
3. Blocks visibility through smoke grenades when enabled
4. Removes hidden enemies from the transmit list - pawn, weapons, wearables, hostage carry props, and scene-node child owners
5. Applies NOINTERP on reveal transitions to prevent rubber-banding
6. Fails open if the ray budget or entity-closure safety checks cannot complete

**Safety windows** during warmup, freeze time, round start, spawns, deaths, and round end ensure players are always visible when gameplay demands it. Dead and dying player pawns are never hidden by S2FOW.

## Entity Coverage

| Entity Type | Source | Handled |
|---|---|---|
| Player pawn | `C_CSPlayerPawn` | ✅ |
| Weapons | `WeaponServices.MyWeapons / ActiveWeapon / LastWeapon` | ✅ |
| Wearables | `C_BaseCombatCharacter.m_hMyWearables` (gloves, accessories) | ✅ |
| Scene-node children | `CGameSceneNode.Child / NextSibling / Owner` closure | ✅ |
| Carried hostage | `HostageServices.CarriedHostage` | ✅ |
| Hostage carry prop | `HostageServices.CarriedHostageProp` | ✅ |
| Player controller | Scoreboard only — left transmitted | ✅ |

![LOS Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karola3vax/server-assets/main/los-editor.png)

Hiding all child entities atomically prevents the `FATAL ERROR: CL_CopyExistingEntity: missing client entity` crash. If S2FOW cannot prove the associated entity closure is complete for a live controlled pawn, it transmits that pawn instead of hiding it.

S2FOW also enforces an orphan-prevention invariant every CheckTransmit frame: if a pawn is already absent from a client's transmit set, S2FOW removes the known associated child entities from that same set. Plugins that mutate CheckTransmit after S2FOW can still violate this invariant.

## Requirements

- [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) (API >= 276)
- [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=dev) (Dev build)
- [Ray-Trace](https://github.com/FUNPLAY-pro-CS2/Ray-Trace) (RayTraceImpl and RayTraceApi installed on the server)
- .NET 8

CounterStrikeSharp, Metamod:Source, and Ray-Trace are external server prerequisites. They are not bundled in the S2FOW release package.

## Build

```
dotnet build S2FOW.sln -c Release
```

Output: `Plugin/bin/Release/net8.0/`

## Install

1. Build or download the release
2. Install Metamod:Source and CounterStrikeSharp on the server
3. Install Ray-Trace (RayTraceImpl and RayTraceApi) on the server
4. Merge the release ZIP's `addons/` folder into your server's `csgo/addons/` folder
5. If installing manually, copy only `S2FOW.dll` and `S2FOW.deps.json` to `csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/S2FOW/`
6. Restart the server - config generates automatically on first run

## Commands

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `css_fow_stats` | `@css/root` | Performance and safety summary: rays, budget, timing, warnings, smokes, closure counters |
| `css_fow_toggle` | `@css/root` | Toggle protection on/off at runtime |

## Config

Auto-generated at `csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/S2FOW/`. A guided version with inline comments is also written.

| Section | Controls |
|---|---|
| `General` | Master switch, death/spawn grace durations |
| `AntiWallhack` | Smoke blocking radius, lifetime, bloom duration |
| `TargetPoints` | Enemy LOS check points, FOV culling, distance tiering |
| `ViewerRays` | Observer ray origin prediction for moving players |
| `Performance` | Ray budget, hitbox padding, hit thresholds |
| `Debug` | In-game beam visuals and HUD overlay |

Default smoke blocking uses `SmokeBlockRadius = 144.0`, counts CS2 smokes as 19.25 seconds for S2FOW visibility (`SmokeLifetimeTicks = 1232` at 64 tick), and uses a 3 second bloom (`SmokeBloomDurationTicks = 192`) to avoid excessive hiding. Aim-ray force reveal stays enabled, but it no longer overrides smoke-blocked LOS.

## Debug

Enable in config for testing only:

- `Debug.ShowRayCount` — HUD overlay with per-enemy decision breakdown
- `Debug.ShowRayLines` — colored beams showing each raycast (yellow = visible, blue = blocked)
- `Debug.ShowTargetPoints` — marks visibility test points on enemy models
